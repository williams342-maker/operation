# Crafters Market — Modernized Homepage + Full Marketplace

_See `/app/memory/CHANGELOG.md` for dated release log and `/app/memory/ROADMAP.md` for the prioritized backlog. This file is kept stable for original problem statement + architecture + personas._

## Original Problem Statement
> "look at my current website craftersmarket.org make it more modern and dynamic"

User selected: **Bold editorial / industrial** aesthetic. Scope expanded into a full multi-vendor marketplace with maker portal, admin console, community hub, AI assistant, 3D viewer, transactional emails, and Stripe payouts.

## Architecture
- **Backend:** FastAPI + Motor (async MongoDB), modular routers under `/app/backend/routers/`.
  - `catalog`, `seo`, `checkout`, `maker`, `stripe_connect`, `admin`, `ai`, `community`.
- **Frontend:** React 19 + React Router + Tailwind + Framer Motion + react-fast-marquee + @google/model-viewer.
- **Theme:** Anton/JetBrains Mono dark industrial (`#0a0a0a` / `#ff4500`).
- **Payments:** Native `stripe` SDK (15.0.1) for Connect Express + Checkout Sessions; `emergentintegrations` StripeCheckout for webhook verification.
- **AI:** Emergent LLM Key (Claude Sonnet 4.5) with per-session transcript replay for memory.
- **Auth:** Magic-link (`itsdangerous`) for makers/admins/buyers; JWT for sessions.

## Collections
products · makers · reviews · blog_posts · custom_orders · maker_applications · activity_events · payment_transactions · ai_chats · download_unlocks · maker_payouts · community_users · community_messages · community_threads · community_files

## Public + Private Routes
- `/`, `/shop`, `/shop/:slug`, `/makers`, `/makers/:slug`, `/journal`, `/cart`, `/checkout/success`, `/contact`, `/policy`, `/community`, `/community/login|verify|auth/callback`
- Maker: `/maker/login|verify|dashboard`, `/maker/stripe/return`
- Admin: `/admin/login|verify|dashboard`

## What's Implemented (cumulative)
- ✅ Bold industrial homepage (Hero, Showcase, Categories, Process, ForMakers, Reviews, CustomCTA, Live Activity Ticker)
- ✅ Marketplace: 11 routed pages, Stripe Checkout Sessions, server-priced cart, polling status, cart context + localStorage, custom-order/apply forms, journal
- ✅ Maker self-serve portal: magic-link auth, profile/listing edit (incl. `.glb` 3D model URLs), order viewing
- ✅ Admin console: 4 tabs — Analytics, Users, Listings, Reviews — with magic-link auth + moderator delete
- ✅ Community Hub: WebSockets AIM-style chat (presence, typing, cross-channel unread badges, @mentions, desktop notifs), forums with @mentions, Showcase auto-link to product/maker, monetised design files ($5 unlock after 5 downloads / 6 months)
- ✅ AI Assistant: Emergent LLM Key, persistent session_id (frontend localStorage + backend transcript replay)
- ✅ 3D viewer (`@google/model-viewer`) on product pages
- ✅ Transactional emails via Resend (buyer receipt, ops alert, per-maker alert, magic links)
- ✅ Shipping & tax engine (Stripe `automatic_tax`)
- ✅ SEO module (sitemap.xml, robots.txt, JSON-LD)
- ✅ Cart "gift note" textarea persisted to localStorage (cleared on paid)
- ✅ CheckoutSuccess "create account" prompt for guest buyers
- ✅ **Stripe Connect Express** (2026-04-26):
  - `POST /api/maker/stripe/connect/onboard` creates Express account (idempotent — reuses existing acct_id) and returns Account Link URL
  - `GET /api/maker/stripe/connect/status` syncs charges_enabled / payouts_enabled / details_submitted
  - `POST /api/maker/stripe/connect/dashboard-link` returns Express dashboard login link
  - Checkout Session injects `payment_intent_data.transfer_group` (deterministic per order)
  - On payment success (both webhook + status polling paths) `transfer_to_makers_for_session` runs as background task: groups items by maker, creates one `Transfer` per maker with `idempotency_key=session_id:maker_slug`. Makers without onboarding get a `deferred` row in `db.maker_payouts`. Platform fee = 10% (`PLATFORM_FEE_BPS=1000`)
  - Maker dashboard "Payouts" tab: state machine (Connect → Continue Onboarding → Open Stripe Dashboard) + payout history table
  - `/maker/stripe/return` landing page after Stripe-hosted onboarding

## Backlog (revenue-stream items)
- **Listing-credit packs** — alternative to per-payout settlement: prepaid $5/$25/$100 credit packs.
- **Real off-site ad spend** — currently attribution-only. To actually drive traffic from Google/Meta, wire Google Ads / Meta Marketing APIs (requires user credentials + ad budget).
- **Stripe Customer Portal config** — one-time dashboard step (Settings → Billing → Customer Portal). Endpoint already returns friendly 502 if missing.
- (UX) Surface "soft-delete does NOT refund listing fee" disclosure in BillingTab.

## Backlog (other)
- (Deferred) Refactor `MakerDashboard.jsx` (~1500 lines) into per-component files
- (UX) Replace native `window.confirm()` on listing delete + promote
- (Awaiting DNS) Custom CDN domain `cdn.craftersmarket.org` — guide ready at `/app/memory/R2_CUSTOM_DOMAIN_SETUP.md`
- (Optional analytics) Cohort retention, bounce-rate-by-page, Discord/Slack live-visitor ping

## Next Action Items
- 🟢 **P7 — Real off-site ad spend** (Google Ads / Meta Marketing API) — needs user-supplied API credentials.
- 🟡 **P14 — UX polish backlog** still on the table from the offered list:
    - (e) Loading skeletons replacing "Loading…" text on all dashboards
    - (f) Empty-state illustrations with CTAs (e.g. "No orders yet — share your shop link")
    - (g) Mobile responsive pass on `/admin/dashboard` (12-tab bar overflows on phones; needs sticky/scrollable)
    - (j) Scheduled-toggle for site switches ("turn maintenance ON at 02:00 UTC tonight, OFF at 04:00 UTC")
    - (k) Per-channel chat moderation (delete a single message; mute a user from one room only)
    - (l) Order-level admin tools (refund partials, reissue maker email, refire transactional emails)
    - (d) Backend `routers/community.py` domain split (~750 lines → community_auth/forum/chat/showcase)

---

## Outstanding Backlog
- **P2** Multi-tier Admin Team & Role Management (spec above).
- **P2** Shopify CSV Import (Etsy mapping done; Shopify needs different mapping).
- **P3** Dormant buyer retention — Kit.com automated tagging + auto-trigger discount.

## Blocked (waiting on user)
- Mailtrap DNS verification in Cloudflare (Postmark covers 100% of mail in the meantime — no buyer impact).
- Google Ads Developer Token (22-char) for off-site ad spend integration.
